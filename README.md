# Sapientia 

**Sapientia** (Latin for *“wisdom”*) is a Firefox sidebar extension that reimagines what it means to learn in the quiet moments between clicks.

Think of it as a Latin teacher living in the margins of your browser, a subtle, ever-present mentor who drops a line of ancient thought as you navigate the modern web. Each time you open the sidebar, Sapientia offers a new phrase drawn from the language of philosophers, poets, and emperors, paired with its English translation and a brief reflection on its meaning.
